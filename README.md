To get started you can fork and submit a pull request. Submit pull request **early and often** so your edits can be merged.

For those of you that will be doing lots of revisions, I can also add you as a collaborator, thus you become an "ownner" and can make changes like any of your own repositories.

For any analysis used to create results include that information in the repository also (for example [this nb](https://github.com/sr320/paper-pano-go/blob/master/jupyter-nbs/00-Quality-Assessment.ipynb) has some QC

Please use [issues](https://github.com/sr320/paper-pano-go/issues) to ask any questions you have about content, github, or to note places in the paper that need attention
